                Born in 2022, Baily Grains is an italian based NFT project focused on rethinking the traditional idea of fashion system, from design to production and communication, according to the new possibilities offered by web 3.0.
                <br><br>
                Our mission is based on establishing and defining a solid connection between the work there's behind designing phisical products, and the possibility to enhance them through NFT certificates.
                <br><br>
                By amplifying the traditional shopping experience, the possession of a Baily Grains product, and consequently of your respective NFT, allows access to the brand's headquarters, thus giving the opportunity to participate and contribute to the creative process that lies behind the design of the real garments.
